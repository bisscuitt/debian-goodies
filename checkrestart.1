.SH NAME
checkrestart \- check which processes need to be restarted after an upgrade
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B checkrestart [ -hvpa ] [ -b blacklist_file ] [ -i package_name ] [ -e pid ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B checkrestart
program tries to determine if there are processes in the system
that need to be restarted after a system upgrade. This is necessary since an upgrade
will usually install new system libraries and running processes will still be
using the old versions of the libraries. In \fIstable\fP Debian GNU/Linux
systems this is typically needed to eliminate a system exposure to a
vulnerability which might have been fixed by upgrading a library which that
process makes use of.

.P 
Consequently,
.B checkrestart
is sometimes used as an audit tool to find outdated versions of libraries in use,
particularly after security upgrades. Administrators should not, however, rely
on its output completely (see \fBBUGS\fP below).

.P 
This script needs to run as root in order to obtain the information it needs
for analysis.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BI -h, --help
Show the program help and exit.

.TP
.BI -v, --verbose
Generate detailed output. This output includes the list of all
processes found using deleted files or descriptors as well as the deleted files
and descriptors found.

.TP
.BI -p, --package
Only process deleted files that belong to a package, ignoring deleted files
which do not have an associated package in the package system.

.TP
.BI -a, --all
Process all deleted files regardless of location. This makes 
the program analyse deleted files even if they would be discarded
because they are located in locations, such as 
.I /tmp
, which are known to produce false positives. It will take preceded if used
simultaneously with the 
.I -p
option.

.TP
.BI -b\ file, --blacklist=file
Read a blacklist of regular expressions from
.I file.
Any files matching the patterns will be ignored.

.TP
.BI -i\ name, --ignore=name
Ignore services that are associated to the package name provided in
.I name.
.TP

.BI -e\ pid, --excludepid=pid
Exclude processes running with
.I pid 
when looking for open files. This can speed up checkrestart on systems with a
large number of open files
.TP

.TP
.BI -e\ pid, --excludepid=pid
Exclude process with
.I pid
when searching for open files

.SH EXIT STATUS

The program will exit with error (1) if a non-root user tries to run it. Otherwise,
it will always exit with error status 0.

.SH EXAMPLE

Start it as user root without parameters:

  # checkrestart
  Found 20 processes using old versions of upgraded files
  (15 distinct programs)
  (14 distinct packages)
  
  Of these, 12 seem to contain init scripts which can be used to restart them:
  The following packages seem to have init scripts that could be used to restart them:
  gpm:
          3044    /usr/sbin/gpm
  rpcbind:
          2208    /sbin/rpcbind
  bind9:  
          8463    /usr/sbin/named
  openssh-server:
          22124   /usr/sbin/sshd
  ntp:
          4078    /usr/sbin/ntpd
  tftpd-hpa:
          3417    /usr/sbin/in.tftpd
  uptimed:
          2704    /usr/sbin/uptimed
  cron:   
          3019    /usr/sbin/cron
  postfix:
          22145   /usr/lib/postfix/qmgr
          8892    /usr/lib/postfix/master
  hddtemp:
          3174    /usr/sbin/hddtemp
  autofs: 
          2792    /usr/sbin/automount
  openbsd-inetd:
          3254    /usr/sbin/inetd
  
  These are the init scripts:
  service gpm restart
  service rpcbind restart
  service bind9 restart
  service ssh restart
  service ntp restart
  service tftpd-hpa restart
  service uptimed restart
  service cron restart
  service postfix restart
  service hddtemp restart
  service autofs restart
  service openbsd-inetd restart
  
  These processes do not seem to have an associated init script to restart them:
  isc-dhcp-client:
          3775    /sbin/dhclient

.SH BUGS
This program might fail if the output of the \fIlsof\fP utility changes since it
depends on it to detect which deleted files are used by processes. It might
also output some false positives depending on the processes' behaviour since
it does not check yet if the (deleted) files in use are really libraries.

.P 
If you find a false positive in
.B checkrestart
please provide the following information when submitting a bug report:

.IP \(em
The output of \fBcheckrestart\fP using the \fI-v\fP (verbose) option.

.IP \(em
The output of running the following command as root:
.PP
        lsof | egrep 'delete|DEL|path inode'
.PP

.P
.B Checkrestart
is also sensitive to the kernel version in use. And might fail to work with newer
(or older) versions.

.P
A rewrite to make it less dependent on \fIlsof\fP could improve this, however.
